#NOTED: Only the Adelie Penguins occur on more than one island. The remainder of this research will focus on this.
#As Adelie penguins are the only penguins that are on Torgersen Island, the methodology will be adjusted to focus on the other islands.

#To evaluate whether a proportional difference exists on the islands where other species exist,
#we will conduct a Chi Square test between the penguin populations on Biscoe and Dream islands. 
#We will use Pearson's Chi-squared Test for Count Data. Significance will be evaluated with an alpha of 0.05.

#Create a matrix within the chisq() function with the sum of penguin species on each island.

  sum(with(PenguinsSpeciesBiscoe, species == "Gentoo"), na.rm = T),

  sum(with(PenguinsSpeciesDream, species == "Adelie"), na.rm = T)),

#We reject our null hypothesis that there is no difference in the proportion between the Adelie 
#and other penguin species on Biscoe and Dream island.  It is important to recognize that any difference 
#in this relationship is driven by unknown variables, such as the geographic features, predators, 
#and competitive differences unique to local species.
